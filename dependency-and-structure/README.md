## Dependency and structure

This package takes YAML objects, replaces the identifiers of whats depended upon with references, adds dependent references in other direction and normalises the hierarchical structure.

It is written to use YAML objects parsed and formatted by [js-yaml](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml).

Used by the renderer and some of the processors in [Eunice](https://github.com/DevSnicket/Eunice).
