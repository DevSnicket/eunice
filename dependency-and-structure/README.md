# Eunice [![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevSnicket/eunice-renderer/master/getSvgElementForStack/createArrows/testCase.svg?sanitize=true)](Renderer/getSvgElementForYaml/createArrows/testcase.svg) - Dependency and structure

DevSnicket Eunice is a toolkit based on the premise that unidirectional dependencies can be beneficial to structure and modularity in software. Eunice's approach isn't limited to direct dependencies, but includes indirect dependencies as well.

[try out Eunice on Eunice üê∂ü•´](https://devsnicket.github.io/Eunice/renderer/harness.html) ([created with](dogfooding/generate.sh))

This package takes YAML objects, replaces the identifiers of whats depended upon with object references, adds dependent object references (so dependencies are available in both directions) and standardizes hierarchical structure (to support varying YAML verbosity). It is used by the renderer and some of the processors in [Eunice](https://github.com/DevSnicket/Eunice).

## YAML functions

The YAML objects are expected to be in a structure that matches how YAML is parsed and formatted by [js-yaml](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml).

YAML is read using the function createStackFromYaml and can be written/rewritten using createYamlFromStack.

## Stack based functions

When a stack has been read/created from YAML using createStackFromYaml (see above), the following functions can be used on the stack or sub-stacks:

### findDirectionBetweenItemsInFirstMutualStack

This function takes two stacks as parameters, works up the hierarchical structure from those stacks, finds the first ancestor stack that both stacks specified are descendants of, and returns that mutual ancestor stack and what the direction is between the "from" and "to" stacks specified.

### findItemInStackWithIdentifierHierarchy

This function takes a stack and an array of item identifiers as parameters, it will then work its way down the hierarchical structure of the stack specified, looking for an item that matches the identifier specified at that index and returns the item that matches the last identifier specified. If at any point during this process there are no child items or an child item can't be found with a matching identifier, an error is thrown.

### isInnerStack

This function takes two stacks as parameters, navigates up the hierarchical structure and returns true if "target" stack specified is an ancestor of the "source" stack specified.
