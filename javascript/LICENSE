Copyright (c) 2019 Graham Dyson. All Rights Reserved.

Eunice - Community/Trial Edition

These license terms are an agreement between you and Graham Dyson. They apply to the program named above. The terms also apply to any other method of distributing the program.

If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below.

1. Use rights.

a. An individual or any number of users in an organization may use the program to design, develop and test your applications released under Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved open source software licenses.

b. An individual or any number of users in an organization may use the program to design, develop and test your applications as part of online or in person classroom training and education, or for performing academic research.

c. Trial purposes. An individual or up to 5 users in an organization can use the program concurrently to design, develop and test your applications for a trial period. The trial period lasts up to 60 days from the first run of the program by an individual or organization. You may only use the Community/Trial Edition of this program for internal evaluation purposes, and only during the trial period, except for: (a) open source and (b) education purposes as permitted above.

d. If none of the above apply, individuals or employees and contractors of an organization may not use the Community/Trial Edition of this program to design, develop or test your applications.

2. Licenses for third party Components.

The program includes third party components with separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be described in the third-party-notices.txt file accompanying the program.

3. Scope of license.

The program is licensed, not sold. These license terms only give you some rights to use the program. Graham Dyson reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the program only as expressly permitted in these license terms. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the program that only allow you to use it in certain ways. In addition, you may not:

· reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the program, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the program, except and only to the extent required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain open source components that may be included with the program;

· remove, minimize, block or modify any notices in the program;

· use the program in any way that is against the law;

· share, publish, rent or lease the program; or

· provide the program as a stand-alone offering or combine it with any of your applications for others to use, or transfer the program or this agreement to any third party.

4. Support.

Because the program is “as is”, we may not provide support services for it.

5. Disclaimer Of Warranty.

There is no warranty for the program, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and/or other parties provide the program “as is” without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you. Should the program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

6. Limitation of liability.

In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who modifies and/or conveys the program as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the program (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the program to operate with any other programs), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

7. Interpretation of Sections 5 and 6.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.
