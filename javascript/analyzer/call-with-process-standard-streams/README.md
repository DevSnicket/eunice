DevSnicket Eunice is a toolkit based on the premise that unidirectional dependencies can be beneficial to structure and modularity in software. Eunice's approach isn't limited to direct dependencies, but includes indirect dependencies as well.

## Call with process standard streams

) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DevSnicket/eunice-call-with-process-standard-streams.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DevSnicket/eunice-call-with-process-standard-streams) [![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/devsnicket-eunice/gitter.png)](https://gitter.im/devsnicket-eunice)

This package calls a specified function with arguments taken from the process and standard input streams. The return value is written to the standard output stream with console.log (e.g. a string).

It depends upon [minimist](https://github.com/substack/minimist) to parse the arguments.

Its used by [Eunice](https://github.com/DevSnicket/Eunice) JavaScript analyzer, processors and renderer so they can be run from CLI and scripts, and have large amounts of YAML passed into (and out of) them.
