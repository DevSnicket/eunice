# Eunice ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevSnicket/eunice-renderer/master/getSvgElementForStack/createArrows/test/withUse/testCases/default-height.svg?sanitize=true) Renderer Test Harness

DevSnicket Eunice is a toolkit based on the premise that unidirectional dependencies can be beneficial to structure and modularity in software. Eunice's approach isn't limited to direct dependencies, but includes indirect dependencies as well.

This package creates a HTML page where structure and dependencies can be entered as [YAML](https://yaml.org/) and viewed as rendered SVG. The render is interactive, its possible to look inside the structure and also list the dependencies counted. More information can be found [in the main Eunice repository](https://github.com/DevSnicket/Eunice#readme).
